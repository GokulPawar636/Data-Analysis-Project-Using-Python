# Data-Analysis-Project-Using-Python

🧠 Data Analysis Project Using Python
🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Python for data analysis, focusing on extracting insights from a real-world dataset. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we clean, process, and visualize data to uncover patterns, trends, and key metrics.

⚙️ Key Libraries
* Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation.
* Seaborn & Matplotlib: For creating insightful and visually appealing plots.
* NumPy (optional): For numerical operations.

✅ Key Steps in the Analysis
1. Loading the dataset
2. Data cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
4. Visualization:
5. Insight extraction:

🎯 Objective
* To showcase how Python can be effectively used for:
* Turning raw data into actionable insights.
* Making data-driven decisions through statistical summaries and visual storytelling.
